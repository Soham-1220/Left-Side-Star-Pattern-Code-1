# Left-Side-Star-Pattern-Code-1

Left-Aligned Triangular Star Pattern

This program generates a left-aligned triangular star pattern using C++. It employs nested loops where the outer loop iterates through each row, and the inner loop prints the corresponding number of stars for that row. Starting with a single star in the first row, the number of stars increases by one on each subsequent line, forming a clear triangular shape aligned to the left. This implementation serves as a simple yet effective example of loop control and pattern printing in C++, and the size of the triangle can be easily adjusted by modifying the number of rows.
